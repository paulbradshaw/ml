## Data preprocessing

Some stages:

* Distinguish between **independent and dependent variables**
* Replace missing values with **imputation**
* Turn **categorical data** into numerical data
* Split into a **training set and test set**
* Get values on the same scale with **feature scaling**

See [prep_py](/prep_py.md) for those steps in Python and [prep_r](/prep_r.md) for steps in R.
