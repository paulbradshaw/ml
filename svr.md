# Support Vector Regression (SVR)

> "SVR has a different goal compared to linear regression. In linear regression we are trying to *minimise the error* between the prediction and the data. In SVR our goal is to make sure that errors *do not exceed the [error] threshold* [epsilon]." - Kirill Eremenko, [Machine Learning A-Z, Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/t/lecture/10459548?start=0)
